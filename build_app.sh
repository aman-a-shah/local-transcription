# Build "Voca.app" with py2app (alias mode).
#
# Why py2app instead of a shell-script wrapper: macOS attributes Microphone and
# Accessibility permissions to the *bundle whose executable the OS launched*. A
# script that re-execs the framework Python hands that identity to the shared
# Python.app, so permission prompts never attribute to our app. py2app installs a
# real native bootloader as the bundle's main executable, so TCC sees "Voca"
# and the mic prompt works. Alias mode references this project/venv in
# place (fast, not relocatable) — perfect for personal use.
